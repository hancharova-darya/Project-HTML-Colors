            Do you feel anxious in a yellow room? Does the color blue make you feel calm and relaxed? Artists and interior designers have long believed that color can dramatically affect moods, feelings, and emotions. "Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions," the artist Pablo Picasso once remarked. 

            Color is a powerful communication tool and can be used to signal action, influence mood, and even influence physiological reactions. Certain colors have been associated with increased blood pressure, increased metabolism, and eyestrain.

            So how exactly does color work? How is color believed to impact mood and behavior? 
</p>

<h1>What Is Color Psychology?</h1>
<br/>
<p>
	In 1666, English scientist Sir Isaac Newton discovered that when pure white light passes through a prism, it separates into all of the visible colors. Newton also found that each color is made up of a single wavelength and cannot be separated any further into other colors.</p>

<p>Further experiments demonstrated that light could be combined to form other colors. For example, red light mixed with yellow light creates an orange color. Some colors, such as green and magenta, cancel each other out when mixed and result in a white light.</p>

<p>If you have ever painted, then you have probably noticed how certain colors can be mixed to create other colors. </p>

<p>"Given the prevalence of color, one would expect color psychology to be a well-developed area," researchers Andrew Elliot and Markus Maier have noted. "Surprisingly, little theoretical or empirical work has been conducted to date on color's influence on psychological functioning, and the work that has been done has been driven mostly by practical concerns, not scientific rigor."</p>

<p>Despite the general lack of research in this area, the concept of color psychology has become a hot topic in marketing, art, design, and other areas. Much of the evidence in this emerging area is anecdotal at best, but researchers and experts have made a few important discoveries and observations about the psychology of color and the effect it has on moods, feelings, and behaviors.

</p>
<div class="box">
   	    	<p>Your feelings about color are often deeply personal and rooted in your own experience or culture. For example, while the color white is used in many Western countries to represent purity and innocence, it is seen as a symbol of mourning in many Eastern countries.</p>
   	    </div>
   	    <h1>Color Psychology as Therapy </h1>
   	    <p>Several ancient cultures, including the Egyptians and Chinese, practiced chromotherapy, or the use of colors to heal. Chromotherapy is sometimes referred to as light therapy or colorology and is still used today as a holistic or alternative treatment.</p>
   	    	<ul>In this treatment:
   	    		<li>Red was used to stimulate the body and mind and to increase circulation.</li>
   	    		<li>Yellow was thought to stimulate the nerves and purify the body.</li>
   	    		<li>Orange was used to heal the lungs and to increase energy levels.</li>
   	    		<li>Blue was believed to soothe illnesses and treat pain.</li>
   	    		<li>Indigo shades were thought to alleviate skin problems.</li>
   	    	</ul>
   	    	<h1>Modern Research on Color Psychology </h1>
   	    	<p>Most psychologists view color therapy with skepticism and point out that the supposed effects of color are often grossly exaggerated. Colors also have different meanings in different cultures.</p>
   	    	<div class="box">
   	    		<p>Research has demonstrated in many cases that the mood-altering effects of color may only be temporary. A blue room may initially cause feelings of calm, but the effect dissipates after a short period of time.</p>
   	    	</div>
   	    	<ul>However, the existing research has found that color can impact people in a variety of surprising ways:
   	    		<li>One study found that warm-colored placebo pills were reported as more effective than cool-colored placebo pills.</li>
   	    		<li>Anecdotal evidence has suggested that installing blue-colored streetlights can lead to reduced crime in those areas.</li>
   	    		<li>More recently, researchers discovered that the color red causes people to react with greater speed and force, something that might prove useful during athletic activities.</li>
   	    		<li>A study that looked at historical data found that sports teams dressed in mostly black uniforms are more likely to receive penalties and that students were more likely to associate negative qualities with a player wearing a black uniform.</li>
   	    	</ul>
   	    	<h1>A Word From Verywell </h1>
   	    	<p>Color can play an important role in conveying information, creating certain moods, and even influencing the decisions people make. Color preferences also exert an influence on the objects people choose to purchase, the clothes they wear, and the way they adorn their environments. People often select objects in colors that evoke certain moods or feelings, such as selecting a car color that seems sporty, futuristic, sleek, or trustworthy. Room colors can also be used to evoke specific moods, such as painting a bedroom a soft green to create a peaceful mood.</p>
   	    	<p>So what's the bottom line? Experts have found that while color can have an influence on how we feel and act, these effects are subject to personal, cultural, and situational factors. More scientific research is needed to gain a better understanding of color psychology.</p>
